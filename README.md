Phase II: User Requirements and Application Specifications 

1. Chosen Development Model: 

For this project, I have chosen to develop my product using the Agile model. The reason behind this is the fact that the business I am working with is a new one in its field. This makes their current requirements not clear and stable. For the moment they are only looking for a website showing an overall view of the clinic’s services. Their involvement is highly needed since they provide new system requirements regularly.  This involves keeping track of what they want to be done, changed or added.  

2. User requirements: 

The stakeholders of this project are the two owners of the clinic. Their requirements as users are: 

The website should present all services provided by the clinic, a general information plus a photo-gallery of the work environment 

A new costumer should have a form where he can type his personal data and this data can be gathered in a database so the staff can call them later 

A sign-in form for clients to complete and for them to send a form with questions needed before they start their therapy 


3. Functional requirements: 

The end-users will be able to create accounts after they register as patients 

The website will provide detailed information about the physiotherapy services offered, including types of treatments, specialties, and pricing 

Provide a clear contact information section, including phone numbers, email addresses, and a contact form 

Save the data gathered by the patients into respectively databases 

 

4. Non-functional requirements: 

User’s login password will be encrypted during storage in the database 

The website should be easy to navigate, with intuitive menus and clear calls to action 

The website should be compatible with popular web browsers 

 

5. Application Specifications: 

I am thinking of creating 4-5 interior pages for my website as described below: 

Home: General information about the history of the clinic, their opening time and some photos form the work environment 

Services: A page which will show all the services provided by the clinic and their respective prices 

Sign-up: A patient must sign up and complete a form which contains question so that the staff finds the best treatment for them 

Contact-us: This page will contain a form for users that need a more detailed information about the overall clinic 

 

Database model: 

I will be using two databases in my website to save two different types of data: 

Data from clients which want a more detailed information about the clinic 

Data gathered from sign up form for clients who are ready for an appointment 

This data will be saved into databases in PhpMyAdmin where each isn't correlated.  

Security measures: 

For the security requirements I have thought of implementing one or both of the below alternatives: 

Strong password policies for the sign-up user form 

Limited login attempts 

Based on how I am going to develop this sign in/up form and what its usage will be, I will decide which alternative will I use.  

Technologies used: 

This website will be built by using these programing languages: 

HTML and CSS for creating forms and styling the webpage (since these are two of the most used front-end languages with more designs available for dynamic webpages) 

JavaScript for handling both frontend and backend 

PHP for backend and database connection

# Project Details

## Project Title: Website for ‘Physiotherapie Dinaj’ clinic 

## Problem Statement:
This clinic is a new business which has been operating only for the last 8 months. For the moment the only way clients can get information about the services provided by the staff is via telephone. However, the workload falls solely on one individual, responsible for attending to both new and returning clients. This arrangement occasionally leads to disarray and dissatisfaction among clients who are unable to access the information they require. 

## Solution Proposed:
The solution I came up with in accordance with the staff of the clinic, is to develop a website which contains all the needed information for new clients. This way, all clients will have a user-friendly interface which helps with all the detailed information they need to determine if the clinic has suitable services for them or not.  

## Project Scope:

I have thought of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP languages to develop my website which will be a dynamic one where each button has a specific action to cover. The delivery will be a fully functional website with interactive features and dynamic content with informational pages covering various aspects of the clinic's services, staff, facilities, and contact details. 

The main limitation of this project is the centered responsibility and the limited skill set in certain situations that may arise.   

- **Aim:** The aim of this project is to deliver a dynamic website that will help the clinic improve its relationship with the clients. 
- **Main Objectives:**
Put in practices all the knowledge gathered during this course and other ones taken during the academic year 

Deliver on time each phase and a good final product 

## Application Description:

The website will include a detailed information for all the services that this clinic offers and their respective prices, a form where the client can add their personal data so they can be contacted by the staff later, a form which will include questions about the physical side which should be completed by each client before their appointment. The patients can also book an appointment by selecting the desired date and time in accordance with the clinic plan. 

# Roles and Tasks Distribution

The project I am currently working on is a website for a physiotherapy clinic which operates in Germany. As the sole contributor of this project, my first duty was to contact this clinic and first understand their requirements and expectations. After that, I have developed a plan of how the website is going to look, what it will include and which languages I am going to use. The main responsibility is to deliver the final product on time and it to be 100% functional.
