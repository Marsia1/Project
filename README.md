# Project Details

## Project Title: Website for ‘Physiotherapie Dinaj’ clinic 

## Problem Statement:
This clinic is a new business which has been operating only for the last 8 months. For the moment the only way clients can get information about the services provided by the staff is via telephone. However, the workload falls solely on one individual, responsible for attending to both new and returning clients. This arrangement occasionally leads to disarray and dissatisfaction among clients who are unable to access the information they require. 

## Solution Proposed:
The solution I came up with in accordance with the staff of the clinic, is to develop a website which contains all the needed information for new clients. This way, all clients will have a user-friendly interface which helps with all the detailed information they need to determine if the clinic has suitable services for them or not.  

## Project Scope:

I have thought of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP languages to develop my website which will be a dynamic one where each button has a specific action to cover. The delivery will be a fully functional website with interactive features and dynamic content with informational pages covering various aspects of the clinic's services, staff, facilities, and contact details. 

The main limitation of this project is the centered responsibility and the limited skill set in certain situations that may arise.   

- **Aim:** The aim of this project is to deliver a dynamic website that will help the clinic improve its relationship with the clients. 
- **Main Objectives:**
Put in practices all the knowledge gathered during this course and other ones taken during the academic year 

Deliver on time each phase and a good final product 

## Application Description:

The website will include a detailed information for all the services that this clinic offers and their respective prices, a form where the client can add their personal data so they can be contacted by the staff later, a form which will include questions about the physical side which should be completed by each client before their appointment. The patients can also book an appointment by selecting the desired date and time in accordance with the clinic plan. 

# Roles and Tasks Distribution

The project I am currently working on is a website for a physiotherapy clinic which operates in Germany. As the sole contributor of this project, my first duty was to contact this clinic and first understand their requirements and expectations. After that, I have developed a plan of how the website is going to look, what it will include and which languages I am going to use. The main responsibility is to deliver the final product on time and it to be 100% functional.
